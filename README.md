# cr-bot-sjr

> A simple **proof-of-concept** _AI_ code review bot using GitHub's
> [Probot][probot], [Langchain][langchain], and [Google Cloud Run][cloud-run]
> to experiment with _AI/LLM_ use in _CI/CD_ workflows on _serverless infrastructure_

**< WARNING: NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE >**\
This started as personal project to experiment with Cursor as an IDE, code 0 to 1 on a project using AI assistance, and to write code that interacts with _LLM APIs_. I chose to use [Google Cloud Run][cloud-run] and [Probot][probot] (a part of the GitHub Actions universe) simply because I'd been using _AWS_ and _Jenkins_ at work.\
**</ WARNING: NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE >**

## TL;DR

Experiment with LLMs in non-production GitHub workflows. Flesh out ideas around _prompt engineering_, CI/CD actions, and model differences by extending this skeleton. Fork this project, then use it to create your own GitHub app. Configure the app with the needed permissions and secrets. Deploy to GCR. Install and configure the app on a repo and start creating PRs to `main`.

## Setup

First, fork this repo and use it to [create a new GitHub App][setup]. Then create and set the appropriate secrets for your situation.

### Repository Secrets

Secrets can be stored with the app and used by all repositories that install the app, or with a repository using the app for repository specific settings.

* `APP_ID`\
  The GitHub App ID assigned when registering your app on GitHub
* `GCP_REGION`\
  The Google Cloud Platform region where the Cloud Run service will be deployed (e.g. us-central1)
* `GCP_SA_KEY`\
  JSON key file for a Google Cloud Service Account with permissions to deploy to Cloud Run
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`\
  API key for OpenAI services used by LangChain for code review functionality ([Create an OpenAI api key][openai-api-key])
* `PRIVATE_KEY`\
  The private key generated for your GitHub App during registration
* `WEBHOOK_SECRET`\
  A secret token to validate webhook payloads from GitHub

### Google Cloud Run Setup

### First Deployment and Completing Setup

After deploying to Cloud Run for the first time, you need to update your app's webhook URL:

* Navigate to your app's settings page on GitHub.
* Under "Webhook URL", click **Edit**.
* Enter your Cloud Run service URL (e.g., `https://my-app-hash-region.run.app`).
* Click **Save changes**.

Your app will now receive webhook events at your Cloud Run service URL.

## Docs for Context

I indexed the following docs to use as context while working on this codebase. Many AI tools will already have some of these already indexed in some way:

* Docker - <https://docs.docker.com/engine/>
* GitHub Actions - <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>
* GitHub Probot - <https://probot.github.io/docs/>
* Google Cloud Run - <https://cloud.google.com/run/docs>
* Javascript - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript>
* LangChain - <https://js.langchain.com/docs/>
* Typescript - <https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/>
* Vitest - <https://vitest.dev/guide/>

## Roadmap

### Ability to Disable Review by Setting a Label

### IaC Managed by Terraform or Pulumi

### Ability to use Other Models Including Ollama

### Better prompt management and customization

### Better installation/setup experience
